            <p>
                I am 25 years old studying Computer Science at Utah State University. I will be graduating in May 2018 with
                my bachelors degree in Computer Science and and Emphasis in Software Developement. I will also graduate with
                a minor in Spanish. My plans for after graduation is to get a job and attend a grad school studying Computer 
                Networking.

                I am from Syracuse Utah where I lived with my family of 6. I have 1 older brother and 2 younger sisters.
                I graduated from Syracuse High School in 2010 and work for a year waiting until I was old enough to serve a
                mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In 2011 I left to the Dominican Republic and served
                as a missionary for two years teaching people about the gospel. I learned to interact and speak fluently to people
                in Spanish.

                Half way through my schooling at Utah State I fell in love with a wonderful woman and in July 2015 we got married.
