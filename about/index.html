            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am 25 years old studying Computer Science at Utah State University. I will be graduating in May 2018 with
                my bachelors degree in Computer Science and and Emphasis in Software Developement. I will also graduate with
                a minor in Spanish. My plans for after graduation is to get a job and attend a grad school studying Computer 
                Networking. I enjoy programming in C++ and feel really comfortable programming in that language. I also know
                some Java, Python, and am learning some C# in my distributed systems class. I just finished an assignment in
                my Distributed Systems class where I programmed a client to communicate with a server through UDP protocol and
                let a user play a word guessing game.

                I am from Syracuse Utah where I lived with my family. I have 1 older brother and 2 younger sisters.
                I graduated from Syracuse High School in 2010 and work for a year waiting until I was old enough to serve a
                mission for LDS Church. In 2011 I left to the Dominican Republic and served as a missionary for two years 
                teaching people about the gospel. I learned to interact and speak fluently to people in Spanish. After my mission
                I moved to Logan to attend school. Half way through my schooling at Utah State I fell in love with a wonderful
                woman and on July 10 2015 we got married.

                On my spare time I enjoy programming, hiking, being outdoors, sports, and watching movies and tv. My favorite
                movie as of right now would have to be the Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring. I am colorblind and
                learn the true color of things everyday from my wife. For 20 years I thought that pine trees were brown to just
                find out that they are actually green.
