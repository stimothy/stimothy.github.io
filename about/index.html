            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am 26 years old studying Networked Systems in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. I plan to 
                graduate with my MS in the spring of 2020. My plans for after graduation will be to find a job as a software
                engineer. I enjoy programming in Java and C++ and feel really comfortable programming in them. I also know some
                Python, C#, and React Native. I enjoy Networked Systems and the logic behind how to get multiple servers talking
                to each other and be fault tolerant.

                Over the summer I had the opportunity to work for FamilySearch as a backend Software Engineer Intern. It is
                an amazing place to work. I love the atmosphere that they provide their employees. They are very flexible attend
                are willing to work with your schedules. The team that I work on is a very helpful team and they have taught me so
                much since I started working there in May 2018. Since then I have been hired as a Student Software Engineer while I
                go to school for my Master's Degree.

                I graduated from Utah State University in May 2018 with my Bachelor's in Computer Science with an emphasis in
                Software Developement and a minor in Spanish. While I was doing my undergrad, I took a Distributed Systems class,
                which was the class I enjoyed the most. I was able to work on a semester assignment where I programmed a 
                distributed budget collaborating system. It allowed multiple clients to talk to multiple servers and log into
                specific budgets. Even allowing for multiple clients to log into the same budget. Users were also able to talking
                to each other through public and private chats.

                I am from Syracuse Utah where I lived with my family. I have 1 older brother and 2 younger sisters.
                I graduated from Syracuse High School in 2010 and work for a year waiting until I was old enough to serve a
                mission for LDS Church. In 2011 I left to the Dominican Republic and served as a missionary for two years 
                teaching people about the gospel. I learned to interact and speak fluently to people in Spanish. After my mission
                I moved to Logan to attend school. Half way through my schooling at Utah State I fell in love with a wonderful
                woman and on July 10 2015 we got married.

                On my spare time I enjoy programming, hiking, being outdoors, sports, and watching movies and tv. My favorite
                movie as of right now would have to be the Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring. I am colorblind and
                learn the true color of things everyday from my wife. For 20 years I thought that pine trees were brown to just
                find out that they are actually green.
