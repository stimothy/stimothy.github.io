<!--<p>
                My name is Steven Timothy. I am a Senior studying Computer Science at Utah State University. I enjoy
                programming and the power to create whatever you want. With that mind set comes many problems. One reason
                this field of study interests me is because I love to problem solve, which any computer scientist knows
                is a big part of their job. Although debugging can be frustrating, the feeling of accomplishment afterwards
                is awesome. My emphasis is software development, but I am also toying with the idea of computer security. I have
                yet to be able to take the computer security class, but I hope to next semester.
            </p>-->
